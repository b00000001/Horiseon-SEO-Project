# Horiseon-SEO-Project

## Optimization of SEO

- This is a refactoring project for the Horiseon-SEO Company. The site as it was had not been optimized for SEO. Using my knowledge, I have combed through the content of the site and optimized images, replaced non semantic elements with semantic elements.

- In the interest of improving SEO for this particular site, a favicon was added, alt descriptions to images for accessibility, updated the title and meta information and optimized images on site for loading times.

**This site was created using the following technology**:

1. [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)
2. [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/)

A demo of the site can be found below:
