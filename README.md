# Horiseon-SEO-Project

This is a refactoring project for the Horiseon-SEO Company. The site as it was had not been optimized for SEO. Using my knowledge, I have combed through the content of the site and optimized images, replaced non semantic elements with semantic elements. In the interest of improving SEO for this particular site, a favicon was added, alt descriptions to images for accessibility, updated the title and meta information and optimized images on site for loading times.
